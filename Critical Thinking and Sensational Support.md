After writing the last article, I have poured water on desk three times. So I think maybe it's time to start a new topic — Sensational Support. 

Actually, a teacher would teach what he knew to the students. The knowledge is the content and importance of the process. The one who accepts some info would input this kind of knowledge and deal with them as the part of system. It's the idealistic circumstance on the right direction. But I refer to one point: attitude or sensation.

Would the students under the teach floor be frienghted when the teacher was angry and act violently? He will. Besides this, he cannot think about the content of the lesson relaxingly.  There is a layer of mood from brain between teach and learn — self-set. The teacher would dislike me and how should I respond his actions?  Am I satisfied to him?  For example, when he looked the math questions on the class, he would feel some insecurity and tough bacause of the natural response to the outside. Only would he grip over the matter of response, he starts his real work — overcome the math puzzles. 

This is a cognitive  pattern. When a man was staying an insecurity env, he would be accustomed of forming a resist mechanism. The mechanism would evolve  a natural process if he didn't recognize it. This is what I want to talk about. Emotional support, an important mount for a man living in PTSD. Sometimes, one would use "the sense of brief" to replace the word. Everyone who was obsecured on it exists the studying barrier to some extent.

The logic is very easy. If u thought the man in front of u didn't like u, do u have a favor on him or do u want to listen to what he said? No, since I know he dislikes me, I want to run away immediately. When the resist mechanism is getting stronger, one would be so sensitive to outside and misunderstand that everyone dont like him. It's the result of wrong family education. Rather than love , a child would be safer with hate. Hate means dislike, ignorance and distance. If love would bring violence, hate is another symbol of security.

The cost is that one cannot build right cognitive  truthfully. If I think the one who taught me music is soft and warm, I would love to study more. Because in inner mind, the attitude of the teachers seems like a acceptance for the learner from the lesson. When the teacher smiles, what the student looked is that "the musical door is opening for me". 

As well, If Astin wants to teach me the theory, I would have a question : teacher, would u stand on the same side with me on this theory? The question is not about game-theory or the intelligence of the teacher. It refers to some acknowledgement from the tutor. In fact, the teacher doesn't have so much mind actions, the question is a way seeking self- comfort. If the teacher said: "wherever I stand , my aim is to tell u the truth". Okay, I get some consensus and want to listen his class.

Sometime the occasion would happen on objects. When I first used the macbook, I thought "he" didn't like me. So I cannot use the keyboard smoothly. It's the root tendency and self-resist occurs from the mind.



No answer, love and self-support.
