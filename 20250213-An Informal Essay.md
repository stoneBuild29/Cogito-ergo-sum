# 20250213 - An Informal Essay

After many years of rational practice, I gradually found an excuse to make myself feel comfortable with laziness and foolishness. If anyone lived just one day in my life, they would likely contemplate suicide multiple times. I must realize that this wasn't  my first time I connected a laptop until I entered university. Compared to those who built successful businesses through computer science, I still stand on barren land. This is inevitable fact.

Practice makes perfect — this is sth all know. And the journey ahead is long. If we don't understand the theory, how can we memorize it and apply it in practical use? In reality, I have encountered many bugs after analyzing the real logic. Failures often hinder my ability to uncover the key before I understand the truth. Some western scientists emphasize the importance of creativity, and I certainly do not deny the aspirations for creativity.

When I read the book A sigh of the Millennium, I came across a sentence referring to Iraq:

> "All I see is that amidst the filth and trivialities, time is no longer treated as time, and dignity is no longer regarded as dignity. Thinking about it, this ancient land has long been too weary to care about the distinctions of human status and honor.

Thus, the care humans have on a country, a family, or themselves depends on their unique circumstances. How can a poverty-stricken country eliminate poverty? It's a ridiculous question. Based on this, a unit has the possibility to open everyone's intelligence. To some extent, this is a pursuit beyond the physical environment.

Knowing this does not make me any better. Hope arises after despair.

> But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, *and* easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.

If someone have not to understand the environment around them, I would say that they are lucky. Encouragement cannot come from a person with much wealth or a girl who pays too much attention to her beauty. Wealth and beauty are pleasant, but they are off-topic. Sympathy is left from those who question themselves, seek themselves, and find their own paths.

With this understanding, I have nothing left to fight for. Because nothing can be changed except for myself. I have given up narrating the past as a non-fiction writer.  Everything would flow through my body, and a life is the min scale on a history.

The ineffective learning method is copying and repeating. The best way to teach what u know. I don't know how to transform the bad method into a better one. Every inner tolerance has its limits. Only when I build the courage to face errors and bugs will true wisdom arise.

Code always reflect real life, but in an abstract way. Whatever programming language  you use, it will rely on the running logic of function in the physical world. Just like coding projects are mirrors of thoughts: one side is the mind, and the other side is the code. Different programming languages are used in different environments for various purposes. Interpreted and compiled languages are vastly different, but there is always sth in common.(though I dont know what it is yet)

AI is gradually replacing coding work. When I first entered the workforce, I asked my teacher, "How long will Java last?" Back then, Java engineers had very high salaries. He told me that Java is born before 30 years. And now, the use of cursor is even more powerful. Life changes not because of anyone's intent, and there are always logical paths to follow. As for when AI will replace humans, I think there's still a way to go. 

~~Because there is an anology between AI and the human neural network, just as humans study the brain to understand how we recognize a small animal as a dog. Some skills we develop through study cannot be explained by ourselves. Through scientific research, we approach the true mechanisms. The brain is the same as astrophysics — both come from hands of God. Perhaps AI and neural science will evolve together, and AI will peak when we realize the limitations of our understanding of the brain. The sentences were written by me yesterday and overthrowed today.~~ I have read the famous flower book and it said "modern AI techologies is aspired by biology researches instead of rebuilding a neural model based on cs".

Every theory should be validated by practice and every practice should be suspported by theory. If the two side is not acknowledged,  the mind is happening too- left or too-right like political spectrum. The right way is a logic closed loop.
