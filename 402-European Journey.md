My first pilgrimage will be to England. I long to stand where Oasis once roared *Don't look back in Anger* into the Manchester night - that anthem that kept my teenager heart beating through years when survival felt optional. Then I'll trace the Thames to Windsor Castle, where stone walls hold centuried of royal whispers.

The journey completes a promise made at my seventeen. I still smell the chalkiest  of  that classroom where our English teacher, having a small talk in the sticky June heat, told us about a former student who had sent photos from its towers. Sweat soaked through my T-shirt as I stared at those castle spires on the projection scren, hormones racing with adolescent intensity."When u grow up," she said, "you will see these wonders yourself." My teenager self could only bite her lip, wondering what privilege made such magic possible.

Now when I finally touch those weathered stones, I'll meet the girl who felt frustated for a pair of ugly pants beyond classroom windows. I will her:"Little girl, let me hug u. You're such a silly child, how could you not know I will be waiting for u behind this castle in the future? Wipe away your tears, let me tell u, u already have the most precious thing in the world. Don't suffer over other things. You will go through many things, you grow up, suffer, lose a lot, but gain even more. Mang things you lose will never come back, so cherish everything you have right now. I will always wait for u here! "

When I leave the castle, I will finally say goodbye to the past, just like Oasis sings, "*Don't look back in anger*". It's a real farewell to the last ten years. I  will also cherish everything I have now. In the next ten years, twenty years, thirty years,where will the future self be waiting for me?
