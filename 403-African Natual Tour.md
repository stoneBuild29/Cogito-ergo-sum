# African Natural Tour

**Bug**

The big issue is that I don't have enough money to support my journey to reach Africa, so I need to come up with some ideas.

*From West with the Night, I have learned that if must leave a place, a place u once lived, loved and buried all your past, no matter how you leave, do not leave slowly. Leave as decisively as u can, never look back, and never believe that the past was better, because it has already passed. The past seems safe and harmless, easily crossed, while the future is hidden in fog, distant, and seems daunting. But once you step into it, the fog clears.*
