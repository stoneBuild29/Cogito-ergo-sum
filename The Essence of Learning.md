# The Essence of Learning

Lately, I‘ve noticed that I spend more time pondering the true nature of learning than simply taking in new information. It feels a bit like being at a gathering where, somehow, I end up missing more than actually engaging. For me, thinking isn’t just about wandering around or mindlessly collecting thoughts — It’s about realizing that the obstacles I face, those “stones” along my path, are reflections of my own mind. When I could recognize these factors, I can trace back all the little clues that explain why I sometimes resist sth new.

A common stereotype humorously suggests that many Asians may grapple with psychological challenges to some degree. I often wonder if a person who craves new experiences yet feels unable to embrace them might be living in a kind of quiet misery. Imagine a thirsty girl  who doesn’t even know how to lift her cup to drink. What holds her back? Is it the scars of her past, some hidden trauma, or maybe the voices of others telling her she’s not good enough? While some might simply blame her for not trying hard enough, I am sure there’s sth deeper at work —— a subtle factor she might not even be aware of until she finally names it and decides to move on.

For me, learning always starts with curiosity. It’s a process that contains some steps: gathering bits of information, mulling them over, grasping some keys of the process, putting in practice , and then reflecting on the answers. I remember as a child, when looked at a flower, I wasn’t just captivated by its beauty ——— I was curious about its details, where it cam from , and even the kind of soil that nurtured it. After comprehending the key concepts through these steps, I would take concrete actions aligned with my genuine interests. And each time my actions fed back into my initial impressions, I found myself tweaking my thoughts based on what really happened —— the fact or the truth. Writing these thoughts down is one thing, but actually living them —— especially without any settled background in physics and psychology —— is an entirely different challenge.

So, what is knowledge? For me, the concept not only describes the pure truth of the universe, but also reveals the common rules that makes things work. It’s a verb and a noun at the same time —— the world and the way that we understand and interact with the world by myself. During pivotal reform periods in a nation’s history, knowledge becomes as crucial as weaponry. Army strategies, unity, game theory, and the strength of soldiers all rely on the strategic application of knowledge. The side that possesses abundant knowledge or practical experience that isn’t traditionally labeled as knowledge often gains a significant advantage provided this knowledge is applied wisely. In this modern world, knowledge serves as a powerful tool for acquiring wealth, enhancing social status, and enlightening minds. The force of knowledge in contemporary society continues to expand, encompassing diverse fields such as mathematics, history, technology and physical exercises.(it isn’t a good example and the lessons are very classical)

Yet, there’s another realization I’ve come to: actually absorbing knowledge is a lot like that girl trying to lift her cup. At first glance, it might seem like a trivial act, but the action for her can be incredible hard. It’s not merely about the physical run. It is about the beliefs behind the action. That girl must believe three things: that there is water in the cup, that she has the strength to lift it, and that the water will quench her thirst.  Minor decisions, such as identifying the contents or determining when to take a sip, are indeed significant but fall outside the scope of this discussion. The three beliefs are symbols on determine, confidence and execution ability to solve problem respectively.

For me, building self-confidence is essential. Without it, I might attack myself by asking endless questions: Why doesn’t the water flow into my mouth on its own? Why must I struggle to drink? Why wasn’t I taught how to simply hold the cup? These nagging doubts can pile up, turning even a simple cup of water into a source of anxiety, uncertainly and fear. From outside perspective, I am refusing the outside. From my mind, the past myself is producing rejection reaction o this knowledge intake. The world or the knowledge to be learned meant a unfamiliar env and a thing u have never looked. Especially one would have long time to stay in the comfort zone, the inertia to keep steady would hinder the adventure. Unfamiliarity means strange which brings some insecurity. One has the stronger wish to get rid of this life, so the anti-force would be greater.

On another view, some negative habits of thoughts often trace back to childhood, the way I have been nurtured and educated. If one cannot stand on the solid ground, taking the first step is impossible. Similarly, just as a seed struggles to break through hard soil and blossom without fertile ground, a mind cannot flourish without a supportive solid. The dissonance between individual and the external env manifests as an immunological response where self-preservation ironically sabotages self-actualization.

And yet, I know that the phrase “Believe in yourself” can sometimes feel empty —— a cliche that doesn’t quite capture   the real work involved. The true challenge is learning how to build genuine self-trust. Only am I sure that I am right, all the actions would have a positive run and feedback. I want to believe that holding a cup or taking on any challenges should be as natural as breathing. So it’s a hard way to do sth that U have ever met. A quote on the Internet is “A man cannot have a life that he has never watched”. Trust yourself, release your power and intelligence naturally.

I find a spark of inspiration in top athletes like Brace Lee and Eliud Kipchoge, whose lives remind me that the blend of physical strength and inner resolve can create something truly remarkable. Their philosophy of movement is truly captivating. When I check the thought, I suddenly thought  why athletes have more intelligence intensively. The result would correspond the true explanation of knowledge. The knowledge is the way everyone build his life. The role you joined, what did u do in a society and what influence do u want to have are the explicit expression from your knowledge reflected in life. Then, the expression for an athlete is more obvious.

After winning, you won't have that pain, but it comes later. The marathon is hard; the second day, you don't go up or down stairs.””
