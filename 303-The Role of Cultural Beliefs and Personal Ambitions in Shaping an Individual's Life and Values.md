In today's world, people are influenced by the beliefs from both life surrounding and original culture. Especially when everyone receives  the overwhelming flow of information from the Internet, one has the autonomous consciousness to choose the faith he believes in. These influences can create inner conflicts when balancing personal ambitions with societal expectations. The essay would explore how cultural ideologies, such as those seen in *Zhuangzi*, interact with the western liberalism behind the advanced technology, a symbol of personal goals and ambitions. This is just a game theory between collectivism and individualism happening to one.

> *In Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, Byron says that Greece is not his homeland, but he chooses to consider it his cultural homeland. Therefore, he becomes a wanderer who inherits the strings of Greece's Iyre. The concept of a "cultural homeland" is a different from that of a geographical homeland, a bloodline homeland, or a political homeland; it is an active choice made by a mature individual for their spiritual home. In contrast, geographical, bloodline, and political homeland are often passively accepted by birth. The active choice of a cultural homeland is limited and can only be found in a few revered yet mysterious ancient civilizations.* 

The Internet plays a significant role in shaping how individuals engage with knowledge and career goals. For instance, while watching technical videos on YouTube, one can feel overwhelmed by the abundance of information available. Professors often encourage understanding complex subjects like cells, C++, and mathematical puzzles. This constant influx of data can create a sense of intellectual growth. However, traditional philosophies, such as *Zhuangzi*, emphasize the concept of "emptiness" which advocates for detachment from worldly pursuits. In *Zhuangzi*, "emptiness" means recognizing that something exists but holds not real substance, a concept that contrasts with the materialistic and achievement-driven approach found in Western cultures.

On the other hand, personal ambition is highly emphasized in Western culture, where individuals are encouraged to pursue their own goals and build careers rather than simply following rules or conforming to collective ideologies. The drive for personal success is deeply ingrained in many societies, where achieving individual goals is often seen as a measure of one's worth. In contrast to *Zhuangzi*‘s philosophy of emptiness, Western culture place significant value on self-improvement and accomplishment. This cultural difference has a profound impact on how people view their careers, values, and sense of purpose.

The environment, shaped by cultural beliefs and societal values, plays a crucial role in shaping an individual's personality and worldview. This does not mean that people lack the ability to shape their destinies, but it highlights the powerful influence that cultural norms have on one's career path, relationships, and overall sense of identity. For example, if a person holds both Eastern and Western beliefs — such as the ideas of "emptiness" and "personal ambition" — they may find themselves torn between two conflicting sides. One side urges them to pursue everything with determination, while the other encourages them to step back and embrace detachment. This inner conflict, often present in people with dual cultural influences, can shape their personality and actions in ways that may seem contradictory.

When these two opposing ideologies meet with within a person's mind, it can be likened to a chemical reaction where both sides are transformed. Through this internal struggle, a person's thoughts and beliefs become more defined, as they navigate the chaos of conflicting ideas. The process of reconciling these beliefs can lead to a stronger sense of self, as individuals consciously choose what aligns best with their values, whether in their career or personal life.

In conclusion, the interaction between cultural beliefs and personal choice has a profound impact on how individuals live and develop. While philosophies like *Zhuangzi* promote detachment and the idea of "emptiness", Western culture places significant emphasis on personal achievement and the pursuit of goals. Recognizing the influence of these cultural forces can help individuals navigate their internal conflicts and find a balance between ambition and inner peace.
