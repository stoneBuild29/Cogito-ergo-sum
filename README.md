# Cogito-ergo-sum

When I practice swimming, there are a few things that need refinement. My hand posture, breathing, and foot flaps. (That's all the actions, hahaha) As I was leaving the traing room, my coach told me, "What you are doing in your swimming is very good, and I'm happy with your performance. But there are three things you should work on subconsciously. Your hand movements aren't as smooth when you are interacting with water. Also, when your hands make a stroke, there's a gap above and below water. This is the ideal gap to take a breath. All of this is happening because your foot flaps aren't keeping u balanced. When your body isn't as stable as a board, you have a tendency to sink. So, your hand movements and breathing are affected. The key to improving your hands and breathing is building your core strength. This is essential, in addition to the special exercises.

The core plays a crucial role in achieving balance, strength, and fluidity in your movements. When your core is engaged properly, it stabilizes  your body and allows for smoother stokes, more efficient breathing, and better overall control. Without a solid core, your body tends to break apart during the movement, making it harder to glide through the water with minimal resistance."
