In fact, I want to talk about the difference of native and non-native languages.  The idea came to me while I was in a taxi, on my way to meet my psychological counselor. I felt a sense of relief about sth, and that's when the thought struck me, so I took notes.

Unfortunately, she has two sons, both of whom committed suicide. There was  shocking news on Chinese social media that labeled her as "evil". I tried reading her books last year, and honestly,  my mind felt fragile after doing so. Honestly, I cannot tolerate the faint atmosphere — gloomy, sad and melancholy. After I throwed this book, I really had an idea to kill myself.

Recently, I open this book again and read over the first chapter. Gradually, I could get what she wants to express and understand her feelings. And there is a strange coincidence that children in books have the same fate as her kids in real life. It made me thrilled.（funk) As a result, I have started thinking:  is she writing her fates? Or do her experiences create the words? 

Gustav has said, "My life is a story of unconscious self-realization". Invloved in past doesn't matter except make oneself feel special. This is a rare experience in a collective society. The unique experience really makes the great literature, but not the best nourishment of real life.If one plan to regard trauma as seed of her life, her life would be full of hesitations. S
