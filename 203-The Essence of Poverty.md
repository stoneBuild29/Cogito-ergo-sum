# The Essence of Poverty

I have many time to think about: the gap between the rich and the poor and why it's difficult for a poor to make money. Here is a article from the magazine.

> Nowadys, wealth and income inequailty remain pronounced across the globe.
>
> "The COVID crisis has exacebrated inequality between the very wealthy and the rest of the population. Yet, in rich countries, government intervention prevented a massive rise in poverty, this was not the case in poor countries. This shows the importance of social states in the fight against poverty. "

> **Income and wealth inequality significant**
>
> The report highlights the extent of global income and wealth inequalities. At a global level the average income for an adult is $23,380(when adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity or PPP).
>
> However, the report's authors explain that this conceals wide disparities between and within countries. The richest 10% of the global population currently take home 52% of the income. The poorest half of the global population? Well they earn just 8%
>
> On average, an individual from the top 10% will earn $122,100, but an individual from the bottom half will earn just $3,920.
>
> And, when it comes to wealth(valuable assets and items over and above income), the gap is even wider. The poorest half of the global population owns just 2% of the global total, while the richest 10% own 76% of all wealth.

> **Interpretation:** The global 50% captures 8% of total income measured at Purchasing Power Parity(PPP). The global bottom 50% owns 2% of wealth (at Purchasing Power Parity). The global top 10% owns 76% of total Household wealth and captures 52% of total income in 2021. Note that top wealth holders are not necessarily top income holders. Incomes are measured after the operation of pension and unemployment systems and before taxes and transfers.

> Interpretation: while over the last two decades global inequalities between countries have declined, income inequality has increased within most countries. The average income gap between the top 10% and bottom 50% of individuals within countries has almost doubled across that time period, the report found.
>
> The importance of between-country inequality in overall global inequality, as measured by the Theil index, rose between 1820 and 1980 and strongly declined since then. In 2020, between-country inequality makes-up about a third of global inequality between individuals. The rest is due to inequality within countries. Income is measured per capita after pension and unemployment insurance transfers and before income and wealth taxes.

> Growth rates among the poorest half of the population were between 3% and 4% per year, between 1995 and 2021. Since this group started from very low wealth levels, its absolute levels of growth remained very low. The poorest half of the world population only captured 2.3% of overall wealth growth since 1995. The top 1% benefited from high growth rates (3% to 9% per year). This group captured 38% of total wealth growth between 1995 and 2021. Net household wealth is equal to the sum of financial assets and non-financial assets, net of their debts.

People often need motivation to keep going. If someone runs, they might keep running consistently. However, most people living in poverty don't have initial capital or assets. They own nothing and must sell their labor. In this situation, they have to exchange their physical strength for money, but it's hard to trade time and effort for a fair reward.

Moreover, those in poverty often lack proper education due to their family background. They don't have a clear vision for the education of the next generation or access to reliable health care. If a family member falls seriously ill and dies, the whole family may slip back into poverty. It becomes a vicious cycle.

For the new generation, the pressure can be overwhelming. After receiving too much education, they may feel a deep sense of sadness when thinking about their situation. They reflect on their origins, the limited resources they have, and the resistance they face from their poor family background. The infighting among the lower class is much more intense than the competition among the truly wealthy.

In this mix of emotions, they may feel both pride and arrogance.
