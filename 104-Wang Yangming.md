> There’s a popular saying these days that Wang Yangming’s philosophy teaches us how to cheat the system because he discovered the bugs in this world. But where are the bugs, and how do we exploit them? I have seen many interpretations, but very few explain it clearly, and even fewer can discuss the principles of Yangming’s philosophy in a way that a middle school student can understand. So in this episode, I plan to strive to use the most conversational language, drawing from my personal experience, to clarify the most valuable insights of Yangming’s philosophy and help u identify the bugs in your life.

> First of all, regarding Wang Yangming’s philosophy of the mind, the term we hear most often is “the unity of knowledge and action.”In fact, as long as you understand these four characters, it is sufficient for ordinary people to follow the natural order and change their fate. To understand the unity of knowledge and action, you need to break down these four characters. What is “knowledge”? It is not knowledge in the conventional sense, nor is it information, and certainly not the so-called principles you learn from short videos. True knowledge is actually desire.

> Have u noticed that all your actions in life are driven by desire? After work, u hesitate to sleep and must scroll through your phone, even though your rational mind tells u it’s time to sleep. But your desire says, “Work is tough during the day; I only have a little time for myself at night, so let’s scroll a bit more, it’s fine.” However, someont might ask, why is it that every morning my desire makes me not want to go to work, yet I still have to go? This is because your desire to earn a living outweighs your desire not to go to work. Choosing the lesser of two evils, the desire to survive pushes u to go to work. Later, Freud replaced the term desire with another word: the unconscious.

> Next, let’s talk about the concept of “action” in the idea of unity of knowledge and action. Literally understood, “action” refers to behavior, and this interpretation is not incorrect. However, to truly grasp the meaning of “action”, I suggest replacing it with another term: practice, which, in the words of Wang Yangming, is called “the practice in the world.”.

> This is quite interesting. You will find that Wang Yangming is remarkably similar to another person, namely Chairman Mao. Both are individuals who possess both thought and the ability to accomplish things; they have both achieved the three pillars of life: establishing virtue, achieving merit, and articulating ideas. Moreover, their understanding of action is astonishingly aligned. If u want to truly understand the character for action, the best explanation is not found in the legendary paths but in the seventeenth essay of the first volume of Mao’s Selected Works, titled “On Practice”. An important point in “On Practice” is that practice is the source and foundation of knowledge. Here, knowledge refers to the “knowing” in the concept of the unity of knowledge and action. It is important to emphasize that this “knowing” is not mere knowledge, as knowledge can be acquired through reading without the need for practice. However, to attain true understanding, one must engage in practice, which shapes one’s subconscious. Now we can draw a preliminary conclusion: desire drives practice,  and practice, in turns, shapes desire.

> After understanding knowledge and action, we come to the concept of unity. In fact, the unity of knowledge and action is not a starting point; It does not teach u to align your words and actions, nor does it simply tell u that knowing sth is right means you should do it. The unity of knowledge and action is actually a statement of fact; it tells us that a person’s understanding and behavior are inherently one and the same, they are a single matter. When u grasp the idea, you will immediately start to identify the bugs in your life. Wang Yangming believed that since knowledge and action are one, if I want to change my desires, or rather my subconscious, I just need to put it into practice. However, another problem arises: some people might say, “I understand the reasoning, but I just lack the motivation to act.” When you pose this question, do not blame yourself, because your desires are too weak, weak enough that they do not have the power to drive u to take action. The reason Wang Yangming was able to achieve sainthood is that his desires were strong enough, strong enough that he could stare at bamboo for seven days in pursuit of truth.

> For ordinary people, what is the right approach? It’s to do things that are below your desires. For example, when u set a flag for yourself to read a hundred books a year, for someone who doesn’t like reading, this task is basically impossible to complete. I consider myself a book lover, but I dont read more than fifty books in depth each year. When u face an insurmountable task, your subconscious will tell u, “Hey, forget it. You can’t finish it anyway, so why bother reading at all?” In this case, your fear overcomes your desire. So what should u do? Instead of setting goals for yourself, replace them with actions. Instead of aiming to read a hundred books a year, just read. Just do it without focusing on the outcome.

> The more you do, and once all your karma is eliminated, you can retire. So, doing things itself is the result. When u approach tasks with this mindset, you can receive positive feedback from them. This positive feedback will then boost your desires, and as your desires grow stronger, so does your motivation to act. This is a virtuous cycle. What if you don’t want to go to work? At least make sure you’re present at the company. What if you can’t sleep at night? Just go to bed earlier; it doesn’t matter if u fall asleep immediately or not. By now, have u found the bug in life? It’s using actions within your capabilities to change your knowledge, and then using that knowledge to guide your actions. When I was in college, I was particularly sensitive and couldn’t control my constant overthinking. Later, I went to see a psychologist at the hospital. The doctor didn’t discuss my family background with me or give me a personality assessment. Instead, they gave me one piece of advice: Just do it, yes, simply act without considering the outcome or worrying about the future. This is life’s cheat code.

> Next, let’s talk about another very important viewpoint in Yangming’s Philosophy of the Mind. Once u grasp this, u will become more rational and won’t allow extreme emotions to sway your judgement when facing problems. It’s Wang Yangming’s perspective on the nature of things, namely good and evil. Wang Yangming believed that there is no distinction between good and evil in the world’s existence. For example, you’re working in a company, and u have a colleague who flatters superious and bullies subordinates, constantly trying to trip you up. This person is annoying to u, but in the boss’s eyes, they are particularly good because they know how to flatter and provide emotional value to the boss. So, the question is, is this question good or evil? Actually, neither, because objectively, there is no inherent distinction between good and evil, which is what Hegel meant by “whatever is, is reasonable.” You might be a bit confused by this point, wondering what it has to do with you.

> Taoism talks about “the heavens and earth are not benevolent,” Confucianism emphasizes the “Golden Mean,” Buddhism preaches the “non-dual approach,” and the Philosophy of the Mind advocates the concept of “neither good nor evil.” All these are essentially saying the same thing：don’t go to extremes in life, don’t see things in black and white or as either/or. In work, dont be overly ambitious nor completely passive; instead, strive for moderation in your efforts. So, where is this moderation? It lies in consitant, gradual effort. In emotion management, some people either negate themselves or blame others when facing setbacks. The concept of “neither good nor evil” in the Philosophy of the Mind reminds us that emotions are not inherently good or bad; it’s all about how we understand and respond to them. Emotions are not our enemies; we don’t need to eliminate them. They are like passersby or scenery; we just need to observe them and allow them to exist. In the past two years, I’ve gradually realized that when people act, they must align with the way of heaven, which is the law of everything in the universe. So, where is this law? The answer given by Yangming’s Philosophy of the Mind is continuous action, and ultimately, the heavens will guide you to where you are meant to be.

This is a article from a famous social media. I think it's good so I rewrite it here.
