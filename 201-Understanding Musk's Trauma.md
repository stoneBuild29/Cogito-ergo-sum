# Understanding Musk's Trauma: A Long-Overdue Observe-Dialogue

He has always hidden behind ordinary public personas like wearing invisible masks — a desperate attempt to bury waves of anxiety. Whenever  he tries  embracing new experiences or people, old traumas hijack his thoughts like intrusive pop-up ads. Maybe it's the best way for him to face this shadow.

**Question 1: Where Did  the Trauma Come from?**

This reminds him of that scene in Titanic where Jack suddenly asks Rose, "Why would you board this ship?" as it's sinking. Some answers come too late. His trauma feels like inheriting another programmer's spaghetti code — historical baggage, childhood environments, and generational patterns layered like legacy bugs until the system crashed. There are different types of trauma based on various criteria. I want to point out three kinds of trauma — personal trauma、event trauma and age trauma. Personal trauma is always said as "*diversity trauma*" which is the accumulation of various psychological traumas over time in life. *Event trauma* refers to a survivor positioning himself  as a victim, both psychologically and in their self-identity, after experiencing a traumatic event. Age trauma is created by me which academic term is "*collective trauma*". It's a situation where a group of people has experienced the same events and this trauma becomes a shared experience and memory.

The most typical example of collective trauma is an entire generation experiencing starvation. Back then, they even started eating grass and human flesh. The hoarding habits of the older generation are a mask of that trauma. That's why when we meet now, we often ask, "Have you eaten?"

**Question 2: How Does he Recognize its influence?**

There's a "high-energy zone" in his mind where brilliant ideas spark. But accessing it feels like encountering encrypted files — he knows the password's nearby but can't unlock it. This conscious helplessness cuts deeper than ignorance. Some people regard this symptom as  a explicit expression of high sensitivity. (Spread my hands

**Question 3: How Has Trauma Rewired Him?**

Trauma affects memory, cognition pattern, and emotional response. And trauma reshapes his momory, reaction pattern and thought processes. This explanation is not just an answer but also a question, suggesting that I must coexist with these memories  — either they still destory him, or does he annihilate them. The old world has been torn apart, and don't look back in anger.

- Hijacked Alerm System: His amygdala(emotional alarm) stays on high alert, tagging new knowledge and env as threats. While studying, 30% of his brain scans for danger — like his body's in the library but his soul's still patrolling old battlefields.
- Shrinking Memory Hub: Trauma has eroded his hippocampus (memory manager) by 8%-12% (per neuroscience studies). That's why formulas vanish like shredded documents.

- Rumination and Thought Loop: He is stuck replaying past scene, adding new captions each time — upscaling a grainy film to 4k against its will. For the trauma situation, the litigant would remember every word and sound clearly. Based on the biology mechanism, the memory saved in his mind is replayed, reshaped and this action is repeated. Every time he recalls the unbelievable time from his memory, he feels a unbearable sense of excruciation. This pain also saves him by making him painful.

These impacts still work within the body. Sometimes he doesn't tell if the trauma run or his own thoughts play a role. The only thing he is  certain is trauma has stood an inexorable site in his growth.

Finally, this is a theory called behavioral knowability. If u dont know how to exert force, lift the instrument firstly. Then your muscle would use force automatically.
