# Cultural Attribution and Personal Fate

I have even read books by Yiyun LI, who insisted on being a non-native language writer. At first, her thoughts confused me about  family development and self-realization. By reading her "Must I Go", I could feel her sadness interwined with family and national affections. Then, it became clear why she refused to have her work translated into Chinese.  Her mind needs language to be a fence that protects herself, and this is exactly why she dropped out of her major. Life gave her the best immunology lesson.

A famous person once said: " Young people don't always plan a big news. A person's fate isn't just about personal struggle, but also about the historical period. When I was in university, I  used to joke about this quote with my classmates. At that time, I was too young to realize that education is the only way to gather people from different levels. When I entered the workforce and observe the workings of the booming national machine, I really hated myself.

In biology, the heart is the crucial organ Because it pumps blood through every vessel system, reaching every summit of body. The blood  gathers from all nodes to supply motivation. I cannot control the bilateral transition even though I have seen too much oxygen in a national system wasted  unnecessarily. A human consists of 4000 - 5000 ml of blood and no one's tears could raise the lake level for one min scale.

Not to mention that the unchangeable mechanism with flowing blood: since birth, the heart has been consistently working until death. God created the basic principles of  life, and a man could create his own garden with his own intentions. In this analogy, cultural attribution is the same as the biological mechanisms. It stands strong and unshakeable.  With the sunlight flowing through me across five thousand years, every pore of mine is obsessed with both the lasting essence and the remnants of trash. You cannot feel it because u live with it for so long. A fish could't realize it's living in water until it jumps out of it.

Currents determine the direction in which fish swim. Various cultural environments shape different personal personalities. A strong sense of culture builds a freedom and striving individual, while a weak cultural environment makes a modest and soft person. This is not reflected in the goal of a very simple action, but in the ultimate, original logical cycle.

Sometimes, I think I have choices within this env. In fact, in this cultural env, there is no other escape path, just submitting to the serious authority. One man soaked in a cultural env and his thoughts would have his thoughts influenced by cultural erosion. He may not realize it keenly and correctly. Suddenly there comes a day when he starts thinking about his life and future. He cannot explain why all they are thinking this way, and he grasps the clue and trace it through family、education and env, reaching the top of the land — culture. It's the magic and invisible force that shakes his mind and influences every seed he has ever planted. For example, many international students seeking knowledge abroad often face issues like cultural shock、racism and communication barriers. Someone could not bear the difficulty of scientific research. At the same time, no Chinese student chooses to drop out, and they have a higher tendency to commit suicide. Some things happen along this way, both in mainland and abroad. Rather than giving up one's life,  stop studying is more shameful within this culture.

The Qin Dynasty unified the land, which was  the most important and unprecedented unity. There were changes that benefited future generations. In cultural terms, the emperor and main officers created a regulation  — “*Burning books and trapping Confucius*” , meaning the rejection of Confucianism, Taoism and any other personal doctrines, while only relying on the legalist philosophy. The ruling class promoted the emperor's divine role and portrayed the imperial court's calls  as the will of heave. Combined with strict laws applied to the people, the Qin Dynasty didn't last  long and was quickly replaced by Xichu and Han dynasty. The Han Dynasty was an intermediate period, learning from the past and establishing  a system that has been used ever since .The key figure of The Han Dynasty was Xiang Yu, a very charismatic figure in Chinese history. His ruling ideology balanced law regulation and moral constraints. Confucian culture once abandoned was adopted again during this period, and many Confucian texts were rediscovered and used. It was during this time that the concept of "culture " rose on the Yellow Land. And this orthodoxy laid a foundational base for Confucian culture.

Confucianism, created by Confucius, originated around 5 A.D. This culture formed during the Zhou dynasty, with core values like benevolence, forgiveness, integrity, loyalty and filial piety. It emphasizes self-restraint and the moral character of a gentleman, focusing on the five virtues and  family ethics, advocating for education and benevolent governance. As a result , it is the best way to unify people's minds. From the ruler's perspective, it's easier for people to follow an intangible moral code than a strict law. It's a less costly way to govern such a vast territory. In this way, there isn't any questions with this culture. And this fault is that not everyone would accept and learn the kind of culture.  The culture is only specified  for the common people.

A ruling tool — what a simple word. For a life, the culture permeates every moment of life.  With the law acting as the shackles on one's feet, he wears them willingly, dreaming of a beautiful and unsealed future. He struggles for himself and contributes to the great regime for the future. He  has no personal dreams, and the traditional dream instilled in him is to cherish family  and peace instead of seeking individualism. About 18% of the population living in this land and according to 2/8 proportion,  about 10% people are living in this kind of collective culture.

A culture is formed and developed by the intentions of ruling class through the flow of  history. No comment on whether it is good or bad. To some extent, what is power? Power is sth on your hand u can't help but use it. When power and culture combine, what  happened? With the current situation and generational transfer, who would be responsible for one generation's  trauma?

This is a topic about cultural selection and personal thought. Just like when I was in Arctic, I could imagine that I was located nearby the equator. It's not about the survival dilemma but more about the personal choice. Culture is a habitat that contains so many lives. Life is a process of self-logical validation. If I'm not  very  satisfied with the cold weather,  laying in the shade of a raincoat is my way of life. But seeking a proper mental habitat is repelling to traditional confucian culture. It's the reflection of  strong culture.

Having said so much,  Let’s look at history. From which line and page can you find the record of the Savior’s salvation? No, never. It has always been those who save others  are saved, and those who are saved save others.
