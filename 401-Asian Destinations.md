I want to travel and see what life on the planet is really like. It seems that many people, after accumulating some wealth, go to big cities like Tokyo, New York, London, or Paris. But I want to go to North Korea. It's strange, and I don't really know why I have this thought. Perhaps it's because recently the ETH cold wallet of a cryptocurrency exchange was hacked, resulting in significant losses. According to the Internet, the hacker was a senior programmer from North Korea. The hacker had undergone a rigorous selection process, similar to an extrance exam, and spent years learning and analyzing systems before becoming an international hacker working for his country. It's said that those who enter the hacking field are usually among the top 1% of society.(This makes me think of my old profession.) North Korea is known for its centralized government and extremism, and I've always thought of it as a backward and isolated place. This hacker has made me focus on this country and sparked my curiosity: what is life like for the ordinary people there? Do the children receive basic education after they are born? Are they happy? Is it because they know nothing and therefore feel no pain, or is it because they know what pain is, just like me?
